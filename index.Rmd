Computers are now as essential for research as telescopes, test tubes, and libraries,
which means that researchers need need to know how to build, use, and share software.
However,
most introductions to programming focus on developing commercial applications,
not on exploring problems and answering questions.
This series of books will show you how to do the latter
both on your own and as part of a team.

The prequels to this book introduce three core skills:
how to write short programs to clean and analyze data in a reproducible way,
how to keep track of what you have done,
and how to share your software and your results with other people.
But just as some astronomers spend their careers designing telescopes,
some researchers focus on building software to make their colleagues' lives easier.
People who do this are called [research software engineers][rse],
and the aim of this book is to get you ready for this role—to help you go from writing code for your own use
to creating tools to help your entire field advance.

TODO: Update section? Needs revision.

For researchers and data scientists who can write functions to create programs that are several pages long,
and who want to be more productive and have more confidence in their results,
this book provides a pragmatic, tools-based introduction to research software engineering.
Unlike material courses aimed at computer scientists and professional software developers,
this book uses data analysis as a motivating example
and assumes that the learner's ultimate goal is to answer questions rather than ship products.
