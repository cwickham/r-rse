# Function development in a package environment

- Process of creating non-function code, checking that it works, then
   converting it into a function
- There are several workflows for this (create in vignette Rmd, make a dev/creating.R
    script as a development location, developing in the examples Roxygen
    section, 'Untitled1.R'). Which to use?
- Mostly *how workflow actually looks like*.
- Building functions up slowly, making small targeted functions that build up
  into a bigger more complex functions
- Process control (if-else, stop, return, switch)
- Dependency management
- Function documentation (with roxygen2), part 1
- To use `@examples` to help with creating function



## Final exercise

<!-- NOTE: Preferably something linked to working towards completing the project assignments, maybe to be used as a milestone? -->
