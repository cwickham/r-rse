# Checking correctness of code

- Using basic debugging strategies ('breakpoints', simple `print()` or `stop()` calls, `debug()`, `browser()`)
- Unit test (with testthat)
- Code coverage (with covr)
- With devtools



## Final exercise

1. Add tests for one function in your package.  You should include tests that:

    * confirm the type of the output,
    * confirm the size of the output, 
    * confirm the values in the output,
    * confirm the correct error messages are received when bad input is given.

    Confirm your tests run and pass with `test()`.    

3. Check your code coverage in your package with `package_coverage()`.  Add at least two tests to improve your code coverage.
