# Version control: Using Git and GitHub as a sole user (part 1)

- Using Git in RStudio (standard add-commit-history)
- Using Git in the Terminal of RStudio (moving in history with checkout,
  creating branches, adding and updating remotes)
- Setting up GitHub for R package (make use of usethis), pushing and pulling
- E.g. with pr_* functions from usethis
- Emphasize exercises to practice, not showing output of git in code chunks (they are a pain to edit afterwards)



## Final exercise

<!-- NOTE: Preferably something linked to working towards completing the project assignments, maybe to be used as a milestone? -->
