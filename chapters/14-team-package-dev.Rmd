# R package development in a team-based environment

-   Making use of GitHub Organizations/Teams
-   Branch protection, member roles
-   Resolving conflict, personality differences
-   Running meetings, code of conduct
-   Decision making
-   Governance
-   Issue assignment
-   Relying on and using code of conduct to build culture and standards
-   Setting up SSH, two-factor authentication, PATs?

## Final exercise

<!-- NOTE: Preferably something linked to working towards completing the project assignments, maybe to be used as a milestone? -->

These exercises are to be done on the *first project assignment* (the
individual-based one). You won't be able to practice everything that you've
learned during this chapter for this exercise. If you have the team-based, third
project assignment, you'll be able to use these skills and knowledge in that
setting.

1. Set up branch protection for your main branch in your package repository on
GitHub.
2. Create a file called `GOVERNANCE` (FIXME: Should this be here?) and write
some general guidelines on:
    - How decisions are made.
    - If and how meetings will be run and held.
    - What culture and standards are valued and how they will be shaped.
    - How conflict/disagreements will be resolved.
3. On your GitHub account, set up 2FA and SSH.
4. In your GitHub package repository settings, create a PAT for working with...
TODO: This item might already be done for setting up GitHub actions.
