## Final exercises

<!-- NOTE: Preferably something linked to working towards completing the project assignments, maybe to be used as a milestone? -->

### For the first project assignment

These exercises are to be done on the *first project assignment* (the
individual-based one). You won't be able to practice everything that you've
learned during this chapter for this exercise.

1. Set up branch protection for your main branch in your package repository on
GitHub.
2. Create a file called `GOVERNANCE.md` (FIXME: Should this be here?) and write
some general guidelines on:
    - How decisions are made.
    - If and how meetings will be run and held.
    - What culture and standards are valued and how they will be shaped.
    - How conflict/disagreements will be resolved.
3. On your GitHub account, set up 2FA and SSH.
4. In your GitHub package repository settings, create a PAT for working with...
TODO: This item might already be done for setting up GitHub actions.

### For the third project assignment

These exercises are to be done for the *third, team-based project assignment*.

1. Assign one team member to create a GitHub Organization account. 
Have this team member add the other members to the Organization.
    - Set each team member with "Maintainer" permissions.
2. Assign another team member to create a new repository where the
project package will be hosted.
    - This team member will then set up branch protection of the main
    branch.
3. In the new repository, create a new file called `GOVERNANCE.md`.
As a group, decide on and write down:
    - How decisions will be made.
    - How meetings will be run.
    - How disagreements will be resolved.
4. As a group, decide on the tasks that need to be completed and
create Issues of those tasks. Together, assign which team member
will do which tasks.
