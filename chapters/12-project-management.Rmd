# Project management of your package development (either solo or in a team)

- Issue tracking
- Labeling
- Project boards
- Milestones



## Final exercise

<!-- NOTE: Preferably something linked to working towards completing the project assignments, maybe to be used as a milestone? -->

1. Create a [project roadmap](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/start-your-project-roadmap/). 
- Create a roadmap for your project describing short-term, medium-term, and long-term project goals. This can be a GitHub issue or a file called ROADMAP.md. Example: [STEMMM Role Models roadmap](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/issues/1).

2. Issue tracking and labeling 
- Create several GitHub issues for your project using your roadmap for inspiration. These can range from simple project improvements (like scanning for typos in the README) to complex feature additions or bugs to be fixed. 
- Create several issue labels that make sense for your project, i.e. good first bug, discussion, help wanted, documentation, feature, etc. Label your issues with one or more appropriate labels.
- Add a link to one or more issue categories to CONTRIBUTING.md. Add a link to issues that a new contributor could attempt, i.e. "good first bug".
- Add links to your issues and/or issue labels to your roadmap.

3. Create GitHub milestones
- Create one or more GitHub milestones based on your roadmap. Add issues to your milestone(s). Add links to these milestones to your roadmap.

4. Create a GitHub Project board
- Create a GitHub Project for your package. Organize your issues from left to right in some version of "to-do", "in-progress", and "complete".
